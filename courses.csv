"ECON 16510.  Water: Economics, Policy and Society.  100 Units.","
Water is inextricably linked to human society. While modern advances in technology and new economic and policy mechanisms have emerged to address water stressors from overconsumption, development pressures, land use changes and urbanization, challenges continue to evolve across the globe. These problems, while rooted in scarcity, continue to become more complex due to myriad human and natural forces. In addition to water quality impairments, droughts and water shortages persist, putting pressure on agricultural production and urban water use, while the increased frequency and severity of rainfall and tropical storms, already being experienced globally, are only projected to grow in intensity and duration under climate change. Students will explore water from the perspective of the social sciences and public policy, with attention on behavioral dimensions of water use and water conservation. Qualitative and quantitative approaches to examining how humans use and affect water will be considered, with particular applications to Chicago and the Great Lakes region.","

ECON 16540.  Urban Spaces and Unnatural Disasters: Humans-Nature Connections in Cities.  100 Units.,"
A natural disaster is thought of an event or series of events caused by the Earth's natural forces and processes. These include hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires, earthquakes, and other events provoked by the earth's processes. But what about the outcomes of such disasters? How do social, economic and spatial conditions affect the impact of natural disasters on the population? What role do humans play in these events and the outcomes? How does human activity and public policy lead to or mitigate large one-time events like oil spills, as well as chronic conditions like deforestation, pollution, and climate change? Are humans part of the natural system in this context or is the human influence considered ""unnatural""? 
This course explores the human relationship to such disasters, including humans as contributors to the severity and extent of such disasters through energy consumption, land use, public policy and other behaviors, and the response by humans to disasters including mitigation, adaptation, and policy formation and implementation. Students will explore how historic policies both created and mitigated environmental vulnerabilities, and how these risks are distributed across the population. Students will study the role of contemporary human behavior in outcomes related to the environment and natural resources through a series of seminal and current readings, and an independent yet collaborative research project using mixed methods from the social sciences.","

Econ 24720 or Econ 22410 may be used as an economics elective, but only one of the two may be used toward economics major requirements. This course will trace in general the history and evolution of economic thought as an intellectual discipline, from the Middle Ages through Adam Smith and the Classical dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries, to the neoclassical period and alternative schools, and then the rise of Keynesian economics and the emergence of the Chicago School of economics in the 20th century. With this background and context, the focus will turn to the theoretical and empirical contributions of important historical UChicago figures such as Veblen, Knight, Hayek, Friedman, Stigler, Coase and Becker as well as the seminal ideas of contemporary scholars, including several Nobel laureates, in the Department, other academic units on campus, and economists elsewhere with deep Chicago roots.","

The standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, including such disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate. Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent, systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. This course looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most be warranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower. To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promoting happiness?","

BUSN 20550.  Application Development.  100 Units.,"
The new reality is that every company is a software company. Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. Many companies (especially ""lean startups"") are purely software-based.
Lacking an understanding of how software works and how software is built puts you at a disadvantage. Our goal is to develop an understanding of both. We believe the best way to do that is to build something yourself, using modern languages and workflows. You will build a functional prototype of your own app idea, and will learn the Ruby on Rails web application framework. Higher-level goals are to:
1. Understand the general, platform-independent patterns of how apps work.
2. Communicate more effectively and credibly.
3. Develop a builder's eye for problems that can be solved with technology.
4. Prioritize features more intelligently by developing a better feel for their costs.
5. Implement a modern software development workflow, from task management to version control to quality assurance to deployment.
6. Be able to make and test small changes to an app yourself.
This course is entirely project-driven. We will build a series of apps in class. Also, you will build your own app idea which will be your final project. This course is designed for a beginner who has never programmed before. 
Note: Due to the intensive support requirements and volume of requests, we can't allow auditors.","

BUSN 20140.  Accounting and Financial Analysis.  100 Units.,"
The course is designed to provide the tools necessary to conduct a reasonably sophisticated financial statement analysis. The focus is on the use of financial statements, although this requires some understanding of the process by which financial statements are produced.
We will not limit our study to the financial statements per se. We will also work with supplemental disclosures, which help the analyst to interpret the financial statements and to understand better the economic transactions that gave rise to them. The techniques we will employ will be useful for both equity and credit analysis. Although this course does not cover forecasting or valuation per se, a thorough understanding of financial reporting issues is critical to being able to do a thoughtful financial forecast and valuation. As a result, this course will be especially useful as a prelude to Financial Statement Analysis (BUSN 20150/30130).
Specific topics include basic concepts of financial statement analysis, revenue recognition, leasing, financial analysis when there is discontinuity (acquisitions, divestitures, accounting changes), accounting for income taxes, earnings per share.  Other topics may be included as well.","

This course teaches you how to analyze financial statements in order to develop financial statement models, assess credit risk, and, ultimately, value a company. The course provides both a framework and the tools necessary to analyze financial statements. Its primary objective is to advance your understanding of how financial reporting can be used in a variety of decisions (e.g., lending and investment decisions) and analyses (e.g., financial distress and bankruptcy prediction). It is applied in nature and stresses the use of actual financial statements. Throughout the course, I draw heavily on real business examples and use cases to illustrate the application of the techniques and tools. Topics include traditional ratio analysis techniques, accounting analysis (i.e., identifying earnings management and accounting quality issues), and financial risk assessment. The second part of the course focuses on equity valuation, e.g., the preparation of pro forma financial statements, and the use of various valuation models. While students with a multitude of interests will benefit from this course, students with an interest in investment banking, equity or credit analysis, consulting, strategy, corporate finance, or management will find this course particularly relevant.","

BUSN 20920.  Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation.  100 Units.,"
We will study social innovation with a focus on the role of social entrepreneurship for implementing innovative solutions to society's problems.
A team of 4 students will be assigned with an innovative idea that addresses a social problem and could become a (for-profit or non-profit) social venture. Students will provide their preferences for assignment from a list of preselected ideas. Teams will essentially develop a business idea around this innovation. To achieve this, students will research the relevant literature, conduct customer discovery, analyze the competitive landscape, validate and refine the offering, propose a business model, articulate a theory of change, and identify an impact management strategy. Teams will present to the idea sponsor at the end of the quarter and in a mid-quarter check-in.
The hope is that there will be sufficient validation and interest to move forward with some of these ventures with students involved in or leading the venture. One path is to participate in the John Edwardson, '72, Social New Venture Challenge.
Much of class time will be devoted to group exercises to implement frameworks to answer these questions for the projects as well as a set of case study examples we will use throughout the course. In addition, there will be readings and discussions on a set of topics to provide a broader understanding of the economics of social innovation and its relationship to more traditional innovation.

BUSN 20940.  Business Ethics.  100 Units.,"
The business environment creates ethical choices that can be hard to think through clearly. It can also subject companies to negative publicity or political pressure, which affects both how they are regulated and how well they attract employees, customers and partners. So business leaders are often called upon to make credible and persuasive arguments defending their products, their firms, their industries, or the capitalist system in which they operate.
Doing this effectively - in a variety of settings - is an essential aspect of business leadership, given the extensive influence of government rules, pressure groups and the media on modern business. This is especially true now, when so many people are raising questions about the role of capitalism itself.
Students in this course will gain experience forming and articulating coherent arguments about the ethics and role of business, by relating their own views to important ideas about business and capitalism and then working to ground them in clear thinking and informed ethical reasoning. We will use this approach to consider a broad range of tradeoffs and controversies that business leaders often confront.","
